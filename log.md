# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Read up on 1-D Arrays and solved a problem.

**Thoughts:** While I could easily grasp the concept, it was a lot of work solving the problem (a "very easy" one) and eventually I took a look at the editorial. Need to improve on both problem solving and efficiency. This will come only with lots of practice.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Strings and more arrays
**Thoughts**: Better performance. Still haven't attempted medium or hard questions, but completely solved 3 easy ones, and partially solved one medium problem (Could not find the optimal solution)

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
