# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Read up on 1-D Arrays and solved a problem.

**Thoughts:** While I could easily grasp the concept, it was a lot of work solving the problem (a "very easy" one) and eventually I took a look at the editorial. Need to improve on both problem solving and efficiency. This will come only with lots of practice.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Strings and more arrays
**Thoughts**: Better performance. Still haven't attempted medium or hard questions, but completely solved 3 easy ones, and partially solved one medium problem (Could not find the optimal solution)

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved two more problems on Arrays - 1 from Adobe (and Google) and another from Google.

**Thoughts** Could satisfactorily solve the Adobe question, and faced no time issues. Tackled the Google problem for well over an hour before realising I'd missed a critical idea in the solution [instead of directly finding the max value, I was concentrating on returning the array subsets]. Took help from the editorial. Definitely growing with confidence, but there's such a long way to go.

### Day 4,5,6,7: January 4th-7th, 2018

**Progress**: Solved various difficulties of problems from both HackerEarth and InterviewBit.
**Thoughts** Nothing much to report other than the fact that I'm slowly realising the subtleties of programming - Missed a ton of edge cases in some of the problems, and definitely had quite a few "WOAHH HOW DID I MISS THAT" moments over these last few days. Unfortunately, the editorials in these places aren't that good. Will look at other sources for same problems and their editorials.

### Day 8,9: January 8th-9th, 2018

**Progress**: Completed Arrays and Math sections on InterviewBit.
**Thoughts**: On to binary search, linked lists, stacks and queues. Aiming to finish these in the next 2 weeks!

### January 10th-30th, 2018

**Progress** : Completed popular sorting algorithms, read about graphs, implemented 3 graph algorithms, and completed the Algorithms track on Khan Academy

**Thoughts** : Looking to complete graphs by this week. Having fun!
